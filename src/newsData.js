    content: `Anthropic, one of the world's largest AI vendors, has a powerful family of generative AI models called Claude that rival OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Gemini. Led by siblings Dario and Daniela Amodei, who left OpenAI in 2021, Anthropic focuses on developing "responsible" AI systems through their Constitutional AI approach.

Claude's key features include longer context windows (allowing it to process more text at once), improved reasoning capabilities, reduced hallucinations, and better instruction-following. Claude is available through a web interface, API, and various partnership integrations with companies like Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, Notion, and Zoom.

The latest model, Claude 3, comes in three versions: Haiku (fastest), Sonnet (balanced), and Opus (most powerful). Claude has shown impressive performance on benchmarks and real-world tasks like coding, research, and content creation.`,
